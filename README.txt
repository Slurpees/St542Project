# St542Project
This is a repository for our project 5.
# Introduction the basic information about our 10 files.
File 1: It seems to be same as the file2. This file includes TTCT score of 249 students.
        But I am confused about why there is a missing Aug Fluency SA in this file.
        Should we add this column from the pdf of FormA?
File 2: It is the same as File1.
File 3: 277 students begining creativity Assessment 
file 4-5: They are Dr.kosal's 20+ and 100+ students begining creativity Assessment information. 
        Could we bind the two table into one? And these students are including in file3.
file 6-7: About 265 students ending creativity Assessment. The twos are separately instructed by Kenny and Kosal.
File 8: High school GPA. About 249 student for this reasearch and the others are not in this reasearch
File 9-10: pdf of TTCT scores.
File 11: Quiz demo for creativity assessment.

# merge these files into __ datesets.
